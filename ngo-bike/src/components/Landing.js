        A Bicycle make a change. The solution is as old as good. To get out of 
        poverty, accessibility is one of the most important tools.  The bicycle 
        drastically improves this in an eco-friendly way. Easy to repair and 
        maintain, in many cases the bicycle is a suitable response to the 
        challenges people face. FABIO is aiming to spread the idea of cycling for 
        a better future.
