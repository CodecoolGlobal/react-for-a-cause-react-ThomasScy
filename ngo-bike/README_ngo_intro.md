# NGO FABIO
The First African Bicycle Information Organization is an NGO that promotes Sustainable transport in Uganda with emphasis on Non Motorized Transport. We use a Bicycle as a tool of social transformation to impact to the lives of the vulnerable in Busoga Sub region. This is achieved through provision of Bicycles to ease access to microeconomics services

Overtime, FABIO has become a one stop center on issues of active transport, not only in Uganda but in Africa as a whole. It is on record that FABIO organized the first ever pan African bicycle conference in Uganda in 2001 which was attended by over 53 Countries across the globe. FABIO Recognizing that most of the African countries including Uganda did not have comprehensive transport policies, we embarked on engagement activities with the Ministry of Works and Transport, Kampala City Council Authority and lower urban councils of Jinja and Iganga. As an outcome, the National  non motorized transport Policy (NMT) was launched in 2013. And FABIO with support of UNEP has spearheaded its implementation on a pilot basis in Kampala, Mukono, Jinja and Iganga Municipalities. Various projects have been started since then to fulfill our mission.
